# Welcome to _The Car Connection Dataset_ :tm:
School Project

I scraped 32,000+ cars with 150 specifications from thecarconnection.com and ran multiple analyses with Pytorch, Scikit-Learn, and Tensorflow. Those incluse PCA, fully-connected (dense) neural networks, decision trees, random forests, svm, etc.

- The specs scraper is [here](https://github.com/nicolas-gervais/predicting-car-price-from-scraped-data/blob/master/scraping), but deprecated(it will only scrape 2,000 cars)
- The [picture scraper repo](https://github.com/nicolas-gervais/predicting-car-price-from-scraped-data/tree/master/picture-scraper) is here.
